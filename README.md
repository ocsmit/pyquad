# pyquad

---


`pyquad` is a python library for generating quadtrees - note: a bit messy and not at all optimized.
A focus is placed on region quadtrees as future use/development will be geared towards remote sensing based algorithms.

A demo can be found within the notebooks folder.

Dependencies can be installed with either poetry or conda/mamba.
